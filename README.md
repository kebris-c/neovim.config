This zshrc is my own customized zshrc. You can copy it and put into your own .zshrc. It is setable with my neovim.config for neovim with some useful alias and others features. Try it !!

As you can see, my other config, for nvim, is so customized too with extra features as valgrind, lldb, shortcuts, plugins... etc. Try it too !!!
